      "description": "Team Grammarly’s product taps into the insight that the effectiveness of a piece of text is as much a function of the context and the reader as it is of the writer’s ability to write. In order to help our users write more effectively, we analyze the style of the text along a variety of stylistic dimensions, and provide feedback on how well it matches the intended reader and context. Finally, we help the user learn by providing suggestions and tips on how to improve when their text’s predicted context and audience does not match their intended context and audience. ",

The first part of the application simplifies potential EV charger installation by giving users an easy way to analyze charger installation and placement and connect them with electricians close by.  The other aspect is a demand-response system that rewards users with points for switching off devices in their homes during grid peak hours as well as gives points to those who charge EV’s at night.",
